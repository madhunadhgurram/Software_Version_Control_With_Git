✅ PROJECT - SOFTWARE VERSION CONTROL WITH GIT

 At first, we cloned a web application from a GitHub Repo.

 And we made changes to the code (such as modifying the data and all).

 Later, we tracked those changes using a VCS (like Git).

Difficulties faced ??
While hosting the web application through Jenkins, I faced errors during the installation of Jenkins and Apache Tomcat due to differences in command syntax across Ubuntu and other Linux environments. I resolved these issues by researching online and seeking help from my mentor.

What did you learn from these challenges ??
1. I learned that when we get stuck, it’s important not to give up but to keep trying different solutions until we find what works.

2. I also realized that discussing problems with others can bring in new perspectives and creative solutions that I might not have thought of alone.

# Amazon Web Services EC2
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), commonly known as EC2, is a fundamental component of Amazon Web Services(AWS). It provides on-demand, resizable compute capacity in the AWS Cloud.
It allows you to launch virtual servers (known as instances) as needed.
EC2 reduces hardware costs, accelerates application development, and simplifies deployment.
# GIT
GIT,which stands for Global Information Tracker, used for software development and other collaborative projects. Git is a Version Control System or also known as VCS, it is basically software designed to record changes within one or more files over time. 
# Version Control System
Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code.
# Jenkins
Jenkins is an open-source automation server that plays a crucial role in the software development lifecycle. It facilitates continuous integration by automating various stages of software development, including building, testing, and deployment.
# Apache Tomcat
Apache Tomcat is an open-source Java application server that serves as a reference implementation of the Servlet specification. It facilitates web application development by implementing specifications for servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Expression Language (EL), WebSocket, Annotations, and Authentication.
Tomcat can be distributed across multiple machines, enhancing performance for building, testing, and deploying applications.
